# Transparent Intention Recognition Using Dynamic Programming (Viterbi, CKY, MED), WordNet, and NLP technics.
1. This is a piece of code contains a server and a client script, whose function is to perform intention recognition on users' input texts.
2. The server is in charge of receiving request and processing the user text, then returning the result to the client.
3. The client script can be called in a ASP.NET application to receive the processed result (the user's intention and other revelent information).
4. The work is done as part of my (Haodong Zheng's) master thesis project. 
5. As for the ASP.NET application that involves the conversational agent, without my supervisor's consent, it could not be made publicly available.
